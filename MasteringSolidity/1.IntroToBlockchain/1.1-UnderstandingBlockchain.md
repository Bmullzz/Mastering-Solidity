## Introduction to Blockchain

Blockchain technology was born with the invention of Bitcoin - a new form of **peer-to-peer** (**P2P**) electronic cash - back in 2008. The Bitcoin whitepaper was released on October 31, 2008 and the first release of Bitcoin came on January 3, 2009. The blockchain space is still a toddler in terms of adoption and the tools available. It has some unique properties that did not exist before in any of the previous systems or software applications. The most important property of blockchain is establishing trust between two or multiple parties without needing any intermediaries, which opens a new era in programming.

Ethereum is one of the implementations of blockchain. Ethereum is an open source, public, and distributed computing platform. On Ethereum, developers can deploy smart contracts written in the Solidity language and build a decentralized application - also called dApp, Dapp, or DApp.

Smart contracts are small programs where developers can define the rules of the trust that intended to code. One of the mind-boggling properties of smart contracts is _immutability_ - once they are deployed on the blockchain, their code _cannot_ be changed. This immutable property makes it very hard to program smart contracts and predict errors/bugs beforehand.

In this chapter, we will learn more about blockchain technology, and when and where blockchains should be used. We will also introduce Ethereum and smart contracts.

The following topics will be covered in this chapter:
- Introduction to Blockchain
- Properties of a Blockchain
- What is Ethereum?
- Introduction to smart contracts
- Why smart contracts are different from traditional software programs

## Understanding Blockchain

A blockchain is a timestamped series of immutable transactions that is managed by a cluster of computers using special computer algoritms. These immutable records are not owned by any single entity. A blockchain is a decentralized P2P network of nodes. Each node in a blockchain shares the same copy of data, also called the **digital signature**. Each node present in the network uses the same algoritm to reach a **consensus**.

A blockchain, by design, is resistent to the modification of data. The ledger can record transactions between two parties in a verifiable and permanent way. Whenever there is a change in the ledger using transactions, changes are distributed to all the nodes, to verify and update their own copy of the ledger. Once a transaction is stored and verified by all the nodes in the network, then it is not feasible to change the transaction without altering all the subsequent and previous blocks. That's why blockchain transactions are irreversible, as blockchain transactions and their data are append only.

Each computer that participates in this P2P network is called a **node**. Each node maintains the records of transactions in multiple consecutive blocks. The P2P netowrk is also used in torrents such as BitTorrent; however, torrent networks are not like blockchains, as they are designed to shares files only.

Blockchain technology is all called **Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT)**, as each node in the network keeps the same copy of the ledger. Please have a look at the following diagram:

In the preceding diagram, each **block** is connected with a link (also known as a **chain**). The chain is usually recognized as the chain of all the blocks. The link between two blocks is implemented by having a record of the cryptographic has of the previous block in each block, so that you can visit the chain in reverse chronological order.

One question that may arise in your mind is, what is the difference between a traditonal software application that processes the transaction and a blockchain that also processes the transaction? Then, why would you need blockchain technology? Well, blockchain technology solved one of the hard problems of computer science - the **double-spending** problem. Let's understand what is the double-spending problem...

- **Note**: It is extremely hard to revers a blockchain transaction. However, there have been cases when a 51% attack allowed an attacker to double-spend coins. One such example is when the **Ethereum Class** (symbol: **ETC**) was attacked with a 51% attack, in which approximately $1.1 million worth of ETC was lost.
